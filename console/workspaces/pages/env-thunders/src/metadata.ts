// ThunderInstancesOrganization or its subcomponents, so consumers that only
// need the sidebar icon/label (e.g. navigationItems.tsx) don't pull the page's
// component tree into their bundle. Route.tsx gets the component separately
// via a dynamic import() of the package root, which keeps it in its own chunk.
