# evaluation-job — agent guide

A Dockerized Python **job** (not a library) that runs Monitor-mode evaluations against agent traces in a time window. Invoked by an Argo `ClusterWorkflowTemplate`. It wraps `amp-evaluation`'s `Monitor` runner, fetches traces from the traces API, and publishes scores back to the platform.

## What it is (and isn't)

- Two files: `main.py` (the job) and `test_main.py`.
- `pyproject.toml` has **no `[project]` section, no dependencies, no build backend** — only ruff/mypy/pytest config. This is intentional: it is never published to PyPI; deps come from the Docker image (which installs `amp-evaluation`).
- Entry point is `python main.py` with argparse CLI flags.

## `main.py` structure

- `OAuth2TokenManager` — client-credentials token caching (refresh when within 30s of expiry).
- `handle_sigterm` → logs and exits immediately via `sys.exit(0)` (graceful shutdown for Kubernetes). It does not set a shutdown flag, and nothing polls one.
- Argparse config validation → evaluator registration from a JSON arg → trace fetch (paginated) → `Monitor.run()` → publish scores.

### CLI flags

| Flag | Notes |
|---|---|
| `--monitor-name`, `--monitor-id`, `--run-id` | monitor + run identity |
| `--organization`, `--project`, `--agent`, `--environment` | scope of the traces to evaluate |
| `--evaluators='[{…}]'` | JSON array of `{name, …config}`; each becomes a builtin evaluator via `builtin(name, **config)` |
| `--sampling-rate` | float, default 1.0 |
| `--trace-start`, `--trace-end` | ISO-8601 window |
| `--traces-api-endpoint` | e.g. `http://traces-observer:8080` |
| `--publisher-endpoint` | agent-manager internal API base for score publishing (e.g. `http://agent-manager-internal:8081`) |

OAuth2 client credentials for publisher authentication are read from the environment (via `OAuth2TokenManager`), not passed as CLI flags.

Traces are fetched via `TraceFetcher.fetch_traces(...)`. Page size is configurable via the `page_size` parameter and defaults to the value set on the `TraceFetcher` instance; this job constructs the fetcher with `page_size=TRACE_FETCH_PAGE_SIZE` (a module constant, currently `10`, to bound memory). Scores POST to `/api/v1/publisher/monitors/{monitor_id}/runs/{run_id}/scores` (built from `--publisher-endpoint`) as an `EvaluatorSummary`-derived payload (`individualScores` + `aggregatedScores`), with exponential backoff (3 retries, 2s initial).

## Commands

```bash
make lint             # ruff check .
make format-check     # ruff format --check .
make type-check       # mypy main.py --install-types --non-interactive
make test             # pytest test_main.py -v
make docker-build     # image installing amp-evaluation from PyPI (AMP_EVALUATION_VERSION arg)
make docker-build-dev # image installing amp-evaluation from local ../libs (PROJECT_ROOT=..)
make docker-load-k3d  # build-dev + load into k3d
```

Config: ruff/mypy target **py311**, line-length 120.

## Gotchas

- The `EvaluatorSummary` JSON published must match the Pydantic schema in `amp-evaluation` exactly.
- Most runtime config comes from `AMP_*` env vars consumed by `amp-evaluation.Config`, not from CLI flags.
- Page size (10) is not a flag — change it in the source if needed.
- For local iteration on the evaluator code, use `make docker-build-dev` so it picks up your local `../libs/amp-evaluation` instead of the published version.

Depends on `../libs/amp-evaluation/AGENTS.md` (evaluators + `Monitor`) and hits `../traces-observer-service/AGENTS.md` for traces.
