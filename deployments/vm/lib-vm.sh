# config.tlsEnabled (env TLS_ENABLED) selects which advertised endpoint variant
# amp-api hands the console for deployed agents: when true it emits the https URL
# from the release binding instead of the http one. It does NOT change amp-api's
# own serving (that is internalServer.tlsEnabled) — it is purely the endpoint
# scheme. The agent host is only reachable over TLS via Caddy's wildcard site, so
# without this the console emits http:// and the browser blocks it as mixed content.
#
# VERSION SKEW: current charts derive the advertised authorization server from
# the issuer, and append publicURL plus a trailing slash to the audience. This
# installer targets whatever published AMP_VERSION the caller asks for, including
# releases predating that derivation, where the defaults pin the k3d hostnames
# these functions have just moved. So both this function and
# observability_helm_args below restate the derived values explicitly. Commas
# stay escaped or helm's --set splits the value into a list.
#
# "urn:wso2:amp" is the amp resource server's identifier — see
# 60-amp-resource-server.yaml in the Thunder extension chart. If a future
# AMP_VERSION changes that identifier again, this value needs to move with it,
# same as the hostnames above.
#
# thunder.baseURL must be the public Thunder URL (same as keyManager.issuer),
# not the in-cluster service address, because it also derives the RFC 8707
# resource identifier admin API tokens are scoped to. thunder.resolveToHost
# points the actual connection at the in-cluster service instead, since the
# public hostname doesn't resolve from inside the cluster. Leaving either
# unset reproduces AUTH-4030/invalid_target failures on every admin identity

# build_platform_resources_helm_args
# Prints PLATFORM_RESOURCES_HELM_ARGS tokens. Two overrides:
#
# 1. OAuth token endpoint. The platform-resources chart's workload-publisher
#    defaults its OAuth token endpoint to the kgateway path
#    (`host.k3d.internal:8080/oauth2/token` + Host `thunder.amp.localhost`). On the
#    VM that route no longer matches: build_cp_helm_args / build_thunder_helm_args
#    move Thunder's vhost to the public sslip.io host, so the localhost Host header
#    404s and `generate-workload-cr` fails with "Failed to get access token". Point
#    it at the Thunder service directly (no gateway, no Host header, no issuer
#    coupling) — the same in-cluster endpoint every other extension already uses.
#
# 2. Default-Environment agent-facing gateway host. The chart seeds the default
#    Environment CR with environment.gateway.http (default am-gateway.localhost:19080).
#    OpenChoreo builds deployed-agent route hostnames as "<env>-<org>.<that host>",
#    and the Environment's external WHOLLY REPLACES the dataplane's, so without this
#    override agent routes land on *.am-gateway.localhost: the console then shows an
#    empty invoke URL and try-out 405s against its own host. Point it at the public
#    agents base (AMP_AGENTS_BASE, e.g. agents.<domain> or agents.<ip>.sslip.io) on
#    :443 so routes resolve to <org>-<project>.<AMP_AGENTS_BASE>, served by Caddy's
#    wildcard *.agents site.
#
#    Set BOTH the http and https variants. Because the override wholly replaces the
#    dataplane's external endpoint, an http-only override drops the https variant
#    dataplane_external_ingress emits. The console reads the https variant when
#    tlsEnabled=true, so an http-only override leaves the binding with only an http
#    externalURL: the invoke URL is empty and try-out falls back to a relative /chat
#    (405) — the very symptom this override exists to fix. Both bind listenerName
#    http (TLS terminates at Caddy) and differ only in advertised scheme.
#
# 2. apiPlatformGatewayVhost.otelEndpointOverride is deliberately NOT set. Deployed
#    agents run inside this cluster, so they reach the gateway runtime directly on
#    the chart's default in-cluster endpoint
#    ("api-platform-<org>-<env>-gateway-gateway-runtime.<org>-<env>:22893/otel").
#    Overriding it with the public gateway host makes every agent egress to
#    <AMP_HOST_GATEWAY>:443 instead, which the sandbox NetworkPolicy refuses on a
#    private-network VM: it allows :443 to 0.0.0.0/0 EXCEPT RFC-1918, and there the
#    public hostname resolves to the VM's own private address. Trace export then
#    fails with "Connection refused". On a public VM the same override happens to
#    work only because the hostname resolves outside those ranges. The in-cluster
#    endpoint is what the sandbox policy explicitly permits and works on both.
