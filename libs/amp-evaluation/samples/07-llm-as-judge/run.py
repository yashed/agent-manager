LLM-as-judge evaluators: Discover evaluators, run Monitor, handle missing API keys.

This sample requires:
  pip install 'any-llm-sdk[openai]'
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=...  (or another LLM provider key)

If the LLM API key is not set, the sample will still run but LLM-based
evaluators will report errors gracefully.
