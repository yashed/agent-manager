@dataclass
class EvalResult:
    """
    Result returned by evaluators — the pure DX model.

    This is the ONLY type evaluator authors interact with. It carries:
      - A score (0.0–1.0)
      - A pass/fail flag (defaults to score >= 0.5)
      - A human-readable explanation of why the score was given

    The explanation field is the sole channel for diagnostic context. Put
    everything the user needs to understand the score into the explanation
    string (e.g. "Found 3/5 required items. Missing: ['term1', 'term2']").

    Score convention:
      - Range:    0.0 to 1.0 (enforced — raises ValueError if violated)
      - Polarity: 0.0 = worst outcome, 1.0 = best outcome (higher is always better)

    Two types of results:
      1. Success: Evaluation completed with a score
         EvalResult(score=0.8, explanation="Good response")
         EvalResult(score=0.0, passed=False, explanation="Failed quality check")

      2. Skip: Evaluation could not be performed
         EvalResult.skip("Missing required data")
         EvalResult.skip("API key not configured")

    Always check is_skipped before accessing score/passed on unknown results.

    Design rationale:
      - score=0.0 means "evaluated and failed" (bad outcome)
      - score=1.0 means "evaluated and passed" (best outcome)
      - skip() means "could not evaluate at all" (not a score)

    Two levels of failure in the evaluation pipeline:

    A skip means "the evaluator could not evaluate this trace." The reason may
