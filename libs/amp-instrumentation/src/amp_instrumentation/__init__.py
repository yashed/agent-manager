WSO2 Agent Management Platform - Automatic Instrumentation Package

This package provides automatic tracing instrumentation for Python applications
using the Traceloop SDK and OpenTelemetry. For agents that instrument themselves
against the AMP manual-instrumentation contract, :func:`init_otel` configures the
OTLP exporter without doing any instrumentation.
