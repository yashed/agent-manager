# Instrumentation matrix — findings log

Every time the matrix exposes a gap that requires either an upstream change, an
observer change, or a schema concession, an entry lands here. Each entry has an
ID, the affected combo, the symptom, what we did about it, and what would let
us undo the concession.

The schema rules in `contracts/traceloop/v1/` and `cmd/gen-contract/contract.go`
should never relax silently — every relaxation has an `F-NNN` entry justifying
it. When upstream fixes a finding, drop the concession, regenerate the schemas
via `make gen-instrumentation-contract`, and **remove the entry** — a fully
resolved finding's rationale lives on in its commit message + the code
comments, so this log stays focused on what's still active. (IDs are never
reused, so removed numbers just leave a gap.)

## Conventions

- **ID**: `F-NNN`, monotonically increasing, never reused. Reference from
  commit messages, contract.go, and code comments.
- **Status**: `open` (no fix yet) or `mitigated` (a workaround/concession on
  our side is in force without the upstream being fixed). A genuinely
  resolved finding is removed rather than kept.
- **Combo**: `(provider × version) × (framework × version)` whose emission
  exhibits the gap. If the gap is provider-only, omit the framework half.
- **Symptom**: what the matrix observes — a missing kind, a wrong type,
  spans that don't validate, install failures, etc.
- **Mitigation**: what we changed locally — schema concession, observer fallback,
  classifier rule, skipped cell. Cross-reference the commit SHA.
- **Re-tighten when**: the precise upstream change that would let us drop the
  mitigation.

## F-001 — Traceloop stringifies every `crewai.*` attribute

- **Status**: mitigated
- **Combo**: `traceloop-sdk 0.60.0` × `crewai 1.1.0`
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-27 (CrewAI cell first record + replay)
- **Symptom**: every attribute under the `crewai.*` namespace arrives on the
  captured span as a Python `str`, even values that are logically `int` /
  `bool` / structured (`crewai.agent.max_iter`, `crewai.task.delegations`,
  `crewai.task.async_execution`, `crewai.task.id`, …). The original v1
  schema declared `crewai.agent.max_iter` as `integer`; emission failed
  validation with `'25' is not of type 'integer'`.
- **Suspected cause**: Traceloop's `opentelemetry-instrumentation-crewai`
  applies `str(...)` (or similar serialization) to every CrewAI attribute
  before calling `span.set_attribute(...)`. Other Traceloop instrumentations
  (OpenAI, LangChain) preserve native types — so this is specific to the
  CrewAI module.
- **Mitigation**: declare every `crewai.*` attribute type as `string` in
  `cmd/gen-contract/contract.go`. The schema reflects reality; if Traceloop
  later tightens, validation tightens with it.
- **Re-tighten when**: Traceloop's CrewAI instrumentation emits native types.
  Check by inspecting a fresh CrewAI cell's `capturedSpans` and grepping for
  any `[int]`/`[bool]` typed `crewai.*` value.

## F-002 — Observer's `CrewAITaskData.Name` has no upstream source

- **Status**: mitigated
- **Combo**: any `crewai *` (CrewAI's Task class lacks a `name` field)
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-27
- **Symptom**: schemas required `crewai.task.name`; cells failed validation
  because the attribute is never emitted. Observer's
  `populateCrewAITaskAttributes` reads `attrs["crewai.task.name"]` and writes
  it to `CrewAITaskData.Name` — leaving `Name` empty in practice.
- **Suspected cause**: CrewAI Tasks are identified by `description` (the
  natural-language prompt), not by a `name` field. The `name` key was carried
  into the contract from `traces-observer-service/opensearch/types.go` comments
  without verifying it had an upstream emitter. Schema fabricated a requirement.
- **Mitigation**: dropped `crewai.task.name` from the crewaitask schema.
  Replaced with required `crewai.task.description` (which IS emitted) so the
  schema still enforces task-identifiability.
- **Re-tighten when**: either (a) the observer is updated to derive
  `CrewAITaskData.Name` from the span name (stripping `.task` suffix) or from
  `crewai.task.description`, or (b) `CrewAITaskData.Name` is removed from the
  observer's data model.

## F-003 — Traceloop's CrewAI 0.60 may not emit separate tool spans

- **Status**: open / unconfirmed (blocked on F-009)
- **Combo**: `traceloop-sdk 0.60.0` × `crewai 1.1.0`
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-27
- **Symptom**: CrewAI cell with a tool-using agent never produces a span
  classified as `tool`. Tool execution appears at least as
  `crewai.agent.tools_results` on the agent span.
- **Suspected cause** (provisional): Traceloop's `opentelemetry-instrumentation-crewai`
  doesn't wrap CrewAI's `ToolUsage.execute` / equivalent. The reference
  repo at `nadheesh/2026-AUS-AI-tutorial` notes
  "openinference-instrumentation-crewai" as the source of agent-spans for
  multi-agent traces, suggesting OpenInference may emit separate tool spans
  where Traceloop does not.
- **Why open / unconfirmed**: F-009 — the harness's `_to_dict` strips span
  *events*. The OTel GenAI semconv allows tool calls to be encoded as
  `gen_ai.tool.call` events on the assistant LLM span rather than as
  separate spans. The captured cassette shows `finish_reason: tool_calls`
  on the LLM response, so the data flow exists; whether Traceloop attaches
  the per-tool-call detail as an event we can't see is unknown until F-009
  is resolved. The "missing tool spans" conclusion may be a harness blind
  spot, not a real upstream gap.
- **Mitigation (temporary)**: `matrix.yaml.frameworks[crewai].spanKinds` set
  to `[llm, agent, crewaitask]` (omits `tool`) so the cell passes today.
  Re-evaluate once F-009 is fixed.
- **Re-tighten when**: F-009 is resolved AND a re-run still shows no tool-kind
  signal (then this remains a real upstream gap), OR Traceloop ships a release
  that wraps CrewAI tool execution as separate spans, OR OpenInference is
  added as a second instrumentation provider and its CrewAI cell asserts
  `tool` kind.

## F-004 — `crewai 1.14.x` × `traceloop-sdk 0.60` is unresolvable

- **Status**: mitigated
- **Combo**: `traceloop-sdk 0.60.0` × `crewai 1.14.5`
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-27
- **Symptom**: `pip install` returns `ResolutionImpossible`. `traceloop-sdk 0.60.0`
  requires `opentelemetry-api >=1.38, <2`; `crewai 1.14.5` requires
  `opentelemetry-api ~=1.34`.
- **Suspected cause**: crewai 1.x tightened its OTel pin between 1.1 and 1.14,
  out of step with traceloop's release cadence.
- **Mitigation**: matrix pins `crewai 1.1.0` — the most recent 1.x version
  whose OTel deps are still compatible with traceloop 0.60.
- **Re-tighten when**: Traceloop ships a 0.61+ release with looser
  `opentelemetry-api` requirements; or CrewAI relaxes its `opentelemetry-api`
  pin. At that point we can bump the matrix pin and re-record.

## F-006 — Traceloop's LlamaIndex `OpenAIEmbedding` instrumentation omits vendor

- **Status**: mitigated
- **Combo**: `traceloop-sdk 0.60.0` × `llama-index 0.12.0`
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-26
- **Symptom**: embedding-kind spans from LlamaIndex have
  `gen_ai.operation.name=embeddings` and `gen_ai.request.model=text-embedding-3-small`
  but no vendor attribute at all (neither `gen_ai.system` nor `gen_ai.provider.name`).
- **Mitigation**: `embedding` kind dropped from `VendorAnyOf` in the codegen.
  LLM kind still requires vendor.
- **Re-tighten when**: Traceloop's LlamaIndex instrumentation emits
  `gen_ai.provider.name` on embedding spans.

## F-008 — Traceloop's LangGraph 0.60 may not emit separate tool spans

- **Status**: open / unconfirmed (blocked on F-009; same shape as F-003)
- **Combo**: `traceloop-sdk 0.60.0` × `langgraph 0.2.74` (+ `langchain-core` `@tool`)
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-27
- **Symptom**: a LangGraph agent that uses a `@tool` function invoked via
  `ToolNode` produces no captured span carrying any tool signal (no
  `traceloop.span.kind=tool`, no `gen_ai.tool.name`, no
  `gen_ai.operation.name=execute_tool`). The graph chose to call the tool —
  the cassette captures a `finish_reason: tool_calls` response.
- **Why open / unconfirmed**: same as F-003 — the tool call could be on the
  LLM span as a `gen_ai.tool.call` event that our `_to_dict` drops. F-009
  must be fixed before this finding can be confirmed.
- **Mitigation (temporary)**: `matrix.yaml.frameworks[langgraph].spanKinds = [llm]`.
- **Re-tighten when**: F-009 is resolved AND a re-run still shows no tool-kind
  signal (then this is a real upstream gap), OR Traceloop adds tool-call
  wrapping for LangChain/LangGraph tools, OR OpenInference is added as a
  second provider.

## F-009 — Harness doesn't capture span events

- **Status**: open (harness bug)
- **Combo**: any
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-27 while investigating F-008
- **Symptom**: `harness/test_cell.py:_to_dict` flattens a `ReadableSpan` into
  a dict with `name`, `kind`, `attributes`, `resource`, `traceId`, `spanId`,
  `parentSpanId` — but not `events`. If a provider encodes a logical
  sub-operation (a tool call inside an LLM span, say) as a span event rather
  than a child span, the matrix sees nothing and misclassifies coverage as
  "missing-span-kind" when the data is actually present.
- **Suspected cause**: my own code.
- **Mitigation**: none yet — the missing tool-spans are being treated as
  upstream gaps (F-003, F-008) but could be in-event in some cases. Need to
  verify before tightening the upstream stories.
- **Fix when**: add `events` to the `_to_dict` output, augment the classifier
  to recognize a tool-call event on an LLM span as evidence of a tool-kind
  sub-operation, and add a matching JSON-schema validation slot for span
  events. Reconfirm F-003 and F-008 with the new harness before closing.

## F-010 — Old SDK pins blow up against the httpx the matrix resolves

- **Status**: mitigated
- **Combo**: `openai 1.55.0` × `httpx >= 0.28`; `anthropic 0.40.0` × `httpx >= 0.28`
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-27
- **Symptom**: `TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`
  at SDK client construction. httpx 0.28 removed the `proxies` kwarg; older
  versions of the OpenAI / Anthropic SDKs still pass it.
- **Cause**: Traceloop 0.60 doesn't pin httpx tight; the resolver picks 0.28+
  (current). Old SDK pins predate that breaking change.
- **Mitigation**: matrix pins `openai 2.38.0` and `anthropic 0.45.0` — both
  support httpx 0.28+. The original `1.55.0` / `0.40.0` numbers in the plan
  were speculative pins I made up, not validated against current httpx; the
  matrix has now done its job by catching that.
- **Re-tighten when**: not applicable — these are forward pins to currently-
  compatible versions; if either SDK regresses or Traceloop pins httpx tight
  enough to require an older SDK, the matrix will surface it.

## F-011 — Heavy tier deploys one representative agent, not per-framework

- **Status**: mitigated
- **Combo**: heavy tier, all cells (most visible on `crewai`, `llama-index`)
- **Discovered**: 2026-05-28 (first green heavy run + design review)
- **Symptom**: the heavy subset is selected "one per framework", but the
  driver deploys a single fixed sample (`samples/customer-support-agent`, a
  LangChain/LangGraph app) for every cell. So a cell labelled `crewai` runs a
  LangGraph agent and can never emit `crewaitask`; asserting each cell's
  framework span kinds against the shared agent fails by construction (and the
  passes — `openai-direct`, `langchain`, … expecting `llm` — only "pass"
  because LangGraph happens to emit an `llm` span too).
- **Cause**: only LangChain/LangGraph deployable sample agents exist under
  `samples/`. The per-framework artifacts that do exist (`cells/*_sample.py`)
  are in-process scripts for the emission tier's in-memory exporter — not
  deployable buildpack apps with an HTTP `/chat` server.
- **Mitigation**: reframe heavy as a **pipeline test**. The subset is one cell
  per Traceloop/instrumentation version on the default framework (no
  per-framework axis), and the driver asserts the kinds the *deployed agent*
  emits (`heavy/driver.py:_DEPLOYED_AGENT_SPAN_KINDS` = `llm`, plus
  shape-validation of every captured span) rather than each cell's framework
  kinds. Per-framework span *shape* remains the emission tier's job.
- **Re-tighten when**: deployable per-framework sample agents exist (e.g. a
  `samples/crewai-agent` buildpack app). Then the driver can deploy the sample
  matching each cell's framework and assert that framework's span kinds —
  restoring a real per-framework heavy axis.
