"""Registry of frameworks that ship a *deployable* agent app under samples/.

The heavy tier deploys a real agent per cell. Only frameworks with a buildpack-
deployable HTTP `/chat` app (an `app.py` + `main.py`, not the emission tier's
in-process `cells/*_sample.py` scripts) can be deployed, so this map is the
single source of truth for:

  * which frameworks the heavy subset runs (harness/heavy_subset.py),
  * which sample each cell deploys (heavy/amp_client.py), and
  * which span kinds the driver asserts for that sample (heavy/driver.py).

`expected_kinds` are the kinds the *deployed sample* emits — for the LangGraph
customer-support-agent that the langchain cell deploys, that's just `llm`; the
crewai agent additionally emits `agent` and `crewaitask`. Tool spans are not
asserted (Traceloop 0.60 may fold them into span events; see FINDINGS F-003).

To make another framework deployable: add a sample under `samples/<name>/`
mirroring this contract, then add an entry here.
