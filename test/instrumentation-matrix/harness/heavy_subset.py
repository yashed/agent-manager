"""Pick a representative subset of cells for the heavy tier.

The heavy tier is expensive — every cell deploys a real agent against a k3d
stack, hits the API, polls the observer. So we run a sample, not the full
matrix.

**Heavy has a per-framework axis for frameworks that ship a deployable sample.**
`harness/deployable_samples.py` lists them (langchain -> customer-support-agent,
crewai -> crewai-agent today). For each, the driver deploys the matching sample
and asserts that framework's span kinds. Frameworks without a deployable sample
(`langgraph`, `llama-index`, `openai-direct`, `anthropic-direct`) stay
emission-only — their per-framework span *shape* is the emission tier's job (it
runs each `cells/<framework>_sample.py` in-process).

Three axes change what gets deployed, so the subset crosses all three:

1. **instrumentation/Traceloop version** — pins the init-container image.
2. **python version** — the buildpack builds (and instrumentation runs) the
   agent on that interpreter, so a py-version-specific break surfaces through
   the deployed pipeline.
3. **framework** — but only frameworks in DEPLOYABLE_SAMPLES.

So the subset is one cell per (Traceloop version x python) for each deployable
framework, pinned to that framework's representative version: the default-cell
version for the default framework, the first declared version otherwise.
