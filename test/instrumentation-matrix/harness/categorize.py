"""Map stage + error text to a categorical failure label.

The aggregator counts by category so triage starts with "what kind of failure
am I looking at" rather than "which cell". Each branch is gated on the stage
that *can* produce it, so future error strings can't drift between categories
just because they happen to share a substring with an unrelated stage.

Branches are matched in order; the first hit wins. Keep the substring matches
narrow and case-insensitive; broaden only when a real failure surfaces a
phrasing the classifier missed.

TODO(phase-6): wire this into ``harness/test_cell.py`` so install and scenario
errors get categorized at the source. Today the per-cell pytest body assigns
category strings directly from validator outcomes; pip / sample-import paths
don't flow through this classifier yet.
