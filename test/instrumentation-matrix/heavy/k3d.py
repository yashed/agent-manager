"""k3d/kubectl helpers for the heavy-tier driver.

The cluster bring-up + readiness is owned by the dev `make setup` chain the
heavy CI job runs (it builds the AMP component images from the working tree
and loads them into k3d), so the driver no longer restores a snapshot or
waits for readiness itself. The only thing left here is per-cell OpenSearch
index hygiene.
