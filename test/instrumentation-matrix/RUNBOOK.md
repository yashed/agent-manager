# Instrumentation Matrix — operational guide

Day-to-day runbook for the instrumentation-matrix suite: how to extend it,
read its output, and keep it honest. For *why* it's built this way, see the
[design doc](./DESIGN.md). For the running log of
upstream gaps and schema concessions, see [`FINDINGS.md`](./FINDINGS.md).

## 1. What the matrix is (and isn't)

The matrix validates AMP's **instrumentation contract** — "does a given
`(provider × provider-version × framework × framework-version × python)` cell
emit spans the observer can parse" — across the combinations declared in
[`matrix.yaml`](./matrix.yaml). It runs in two tiers:

- **Emission tier** (fast, every relevant PR): runs each cell's sample agent
  in an isolated venv, captures spans via an in-memory exporter with VCR
  cassettes replacing live LLM calls, and validates them against the
  JSON-schema contract.
- **Heavy tier** (nightly / on-demand): deploys a representative subset of
  cells against a real AMP stack on k3d and validates the spans that survive
  the full pipeline. (Heavy-tier deploy/poll is implemented but not yet
  validated against a live stack; see §7.)

It is **not** a correctness test of the agents themselves, a load test, or a
console/UI test — it asserts the *shape* of emitted telemetry, nothing more.

## 2. Add a framework, a framework version, or a Traceloop version

All three are edits to [`matrix.yaml`](./matrix.yaml):

- **New framework version**: add it to that framework's `versions:` list. No
  cassette re-record needed — different framework versions produce different
  *spans* but identical *HTTP* (the cassette captures the latter).
- **New framework**: add a `frameworks:` block (`name`, `package`, `versions`,
  `samplePath`, `spanKinds`, optional `extras`), add a sample under
  `cells/<framework>_sample.py`, and record its cassette (§4 of the design,
  and `scripts/record_cassette.py`).
- **New Traceloop version**: add it to `providers.traceloop.versions` **and**
  add a `providers.traceloop.instrumentationVersions["<ver>"]` entry mapping
  it to the init-container `instrumentation_version` (needed by the heavy
  tier — see §7). `make check-matrix-manifest` enforces that this map covers
  every version `release-config.json` currently ships.

**Example — add a new framework (`haystack`):**

```yaml
# matrix.yaml → frameworks:
  - name: haystack
    provider: traceloop          # restrict to the auto-instrumentation provider
    package: haystack-ai
    versions: ["2.8.0"]
    samplePath: cells/haystack_sample.py
    spanKinds: [llm]             # what the observer should classify out of it
    extras: [haystack-ai, openai]  # extra pip installs the sample needs
```

Then add `cells/haystack_sample.py` (a `run_scenario()` that drives one LLM
call — copy `cells/langchain_sample.py`) and record its cassette:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python scripts/record_cassette.py haystack llm
```

**Example — add a Traceloop version (`0.62.0`):**

```yaml
# matrix.yaml → providers.traceloop:
    versions: ["0.61.0", "0.62.0"]          # add the new one
    instrumentationVersions:
      "0.61.0": "0.3.0"
      "0.62.0": "0.4.0"                      # ← the init-container instr version
```

After any edit, sanity-check locally:

```bash
cd test/instrumentation-matrix
nox -s emission -- --cell-id=traceloop-0.62.0-langchain-0.3.27-py3.11   # one cell
nox -s emission -k haystack                                             # by framework
```

## 3. Onboard a new Traceloop release (the canary workflow)

The matrix shadow-tests a new Traceloop release *before* AMP baselines it:

1. `traceloop-release-watch.yaml` opens a `traceloop-release` issue when a new
   `traceloop-sdk` publishes — that's the trigger.
2. Add the new version to `matrix.yaml` (`versions` + `instrumentationVersions`).
   No baseline change yet.
3. Open a PR. The emission tier runs the full cross-product against the new
   version; every new-version cell is **advisory** because it isn't the
   `defaultCell`, so a regression doesn't block the PR.
4. Read the matrix summary (§4) to see exactly which
   `(framework × framework-version × python)` cells regressed.
5. Decide:
   - **All green** → follow-up PR bumps `release-config.json`, regenerates
     `baseline.json`, and (optionally) promotes `defaultCell`.
   - **Acceptable reds** → onboard with `known-broken` entries (§6) tracking
     each regression and its `until:` date.
   - **Too red** → leave it gated or revert the matrix addition; the watcher
     issue stays open.

Promoting `defaultCell` is the explicit moment a version goes from
"shadow-tested" to "shipped and PR-required."

## 4. Triage a red cell

A red emission cell is diagnosed from the run, no local repro needed:

1. **Summary table** — on the `publish-matrix-summary` job's page (GitHub
   step summary, not a PR comment — fork PRs can't comment). One row per
   cell with result + a one-line detail (`category: missing <kinds>` or a
   `path` + message for a schema violation).
2. **Per-cell JSON** — `reports/cells/<id>.json`, with the coverage map,
   violations, and gzipped captured spans. In CI the full matrix bundles
   these into the `matrix-reports` artifact (the gating default cell also
   uploads `default-cell-report`); locally they're written under
   `reports/cells/`.
3. **Triage diff** — `reports/diffs/<cell-id>.diff.md` lists the schema's
   required keys vs what the cell actually captured. `nox -s report`
   generates these for failing cells.

The `category` tells you whose problem it likely is (design §12.1):
`install-failure` (manifest), `sample-import-failure` (sample/framework),
`no-spans-captured` / `missing-span-kind` (provider), `schema-violation`
(provider or observer), `cassette-miss` (sample or provider),
`pipeline-error` / `infra-error` (heavy-tier infra/observer).

**Example — a red row + its diff.** The summary shows:

```text
| ❌ traceloop-0.61.0-langgraph-0.2.74-py3.11 | fail | missing-span-kind: missing ['tool'] |
```

and `reports/diffs/traceloop-0.61.0-langgraph-0.2.74-py3.11.diff.md` shows which
required keys were present vs missing:

```
## Required attributes vs captured
| Required key            | Status      |
| ---                     | ---         |
| gen_ai.request.model    | present     |
| traceloop.span.kind     | present     |
| (tool-kind span)        | **MISSING** |
```

→ category `missing-span-kind` points at the provider (partial
instrumentation). Reading the diff is usually enough to reach a verdict
without reproducing locally.

If a regression is upstream and you can't fix it now, record it in
[`FINDINGS.md`](./FINDINGS.md) with an `F-NNN` id and gate the cell with
`known-broken` (§6).

## 5. Add a new instrumentation provider

A *provider* is the swap point that lets the matrix test OpenInference /
OpenLit / vanilla-OTel later without rewriting cells. To add one:

1. Implement the `InstrumentationProvider` Protocol in
   `harness/provider.py` — see `providers/traceloop.py` and
   `providers/manual.py` as worked examples. You need:
   - `name`
   - `package_specs(version)` → pip specs the cell venv installs
   - `bootstrap_module()` → a sitecustomize-style module that initialises the
     SDK against an `InMemorySpanExporter` (mirror
     `providers/bootstrap/traceloop/sitecustomize.py`)
   - `contract_schema_id()` → which schema bundle validates its spans
   - `normalize_span(raw)` → optional namespace folding (default identity)
2. Register it in `providers/__init__.py`'s `PROVIDERS` dict.
3. Add a contract schema bundle under `contracts/<provider>/<version>/` if the
   provider emits a different shape (Traceloop and manual share `traceloop/v1`).
4. Reference it from `matrix.yaml` — either as a provider every framework
   cross-products with, or pinned to specific frameworks via a `provider:`
   restriction (as `manual-rag` does for the `manual` provider).

`ManualProvider` is the simplest worked example: it installs only stdlib
OpenTelemetry (`opentelemetry-sdk`/`-api`), and its sitecustomize wires a
`TracerProvider` + `InMemorySpanExporter` directly — deliberately *not*
calling `amp_instrumentation.init_otel()`, since that ships spans over OTLP
and the in-memory harness replaces that path. It validates against the
*same* `traceloop/v1` schema as the auto path — the observer reads one shape
regardless of source.

## 6. The `known-broken` workflow

When a cell exposes a regression you can't fix immediately:

1. Add an entry under `matrix.yaml.known-broken` with the `cell` match
   pattern (a subset of `provider`/`providerVersion`/`framework`/
   `frameworkVersion`/`python` — missing keys widen the match), a `reason`,
   and an `until:` ISO date.

   ```yaml
   # matrix.yaml → known-broken:
     # gate one specific cell:
     - cell:
         provider: traceloop
         providerVersion: "0.61.0"
         framework: crewai
         frameworkVersion: "1.1.0"
       reason: "F-012: traceloop 0.61 drops crewai tool spans"
       until: "2026-09-01"
     # …or widen by omitting keys — this gates ALL crewai cells on 0.61:
     - cell: { provider: traceloop, providerVersion: "0.61.0", framework: crewai }
       reason: "F-012"
       until: "2026-09-01"
   ```

2. The matrix still expands and reports the cell, but as
   `skipped-known-broken`, so it doesn't block the PR.
3. Nightly, the `revalidate-known-broken` job re-runs every known-broken cell
   unconditionally. If a previously-broken cell now **passes**, it opens an
   issue (titled "known-broken cells now passing — drop exemptions", labeled
   `instrumentation-matrix-revalidate`) suggesting you drop the exemption.
4. Past `until:`, the cell un-skips automatically — forcing a deliberate
   re-extend or fix rather than letting an exemption rot silently.

Pair every `known-broken` entry with an `F-NNN` entry in `FINDINGS.md` so the
"why" survives.

## 7. Heavy tier (deploy contract + ops)

The heavy tier (`nox -s heavy`, `heavy/driver.py`) is a **pipeline test**: it
deploys a real agent against a real AMP stack on k3d, invokes it, polls
`traces-observer-service`, and checks that the spans survive the full path
(auto-instrumentation → gateway → collector → OpenSearch → observer) and
validate against the `traceloop/v1` contract.

It has a **per-framework axis for frameworks that ship a deployable sample**.
`harness/deployable_samples.py` maps each such framework to its sample app
path, run command, and the span kinds the driver asserts:

- `langchain` → `samples/customer-support-agent` (LangChain/LangGraph), asserts `llm`
- `crewai` → `samples/crewai-agent`, asserts `llm` + `agent` + `crewaitask`

The driver deploys the sample matching each cell's framework and asserts that
framework's kinds (plus shape-validation of every captured span). The other two
axes that change the deployed agent are the **instrumentation/Traceloop
version** (the init-container image) and the **python version** (the buildpack
interpreter). So the subset (`harness/heavy_subset.py`) is one cell per
(Traceloop version × python) for each deployable framework, pinned to that
framework's representative version. With one Traceloop version, four pythons,
and two deployable frameworks that's eight cells.

Frameworks without a deployable sample (`langgraph`, `llama-index`,
`openai-direct`, `anthropic-direct`) stay emission-only — per-framework span
*shape* for them is the emission tier's job. Adding a deployable sample under
`samples/` plus a `DEPLOYABLE_SAMPLES` entry is what brings a framework into the
heavy axis.

### Bring-up: build-from-source

The CI heavy job stands up AMP from the **working tree** via the dev
`make setup` chain, wrapped in the `.github/actions/amp-dev-stack` composite:
`setup-k3d` → `setup-openchoreo` (builds + `k3d image import`s the
traces-observer + python-instrumentation-provider images from source) →
`setup-platform` (agent-manager-service via docker-compose) → migrate →
port-forward → gateway.

This is deliberately **not** `deployments/quick-start/install.sh`, which
deploys *released* images at a pinned `VERSION` (that's what e2e uses). The
matrix's job is to catch regressions in the PR's observer + instrumentation
code, so it must run the PR's images.

### Environment

The only real **secrets** are the LLM keys; everything else defaults to the
values the dev bring-up exposes (overridable, never required):

| Variable | Kind | Default / source |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | **secret** | forwarded into each deployed agent so it can make real calls |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | **secret** | for the anthropic-direct cell |
| `AMP_API_BASE_URL` | default | `http://localhost:9000` |
| `TRACES_OBSERVER_BASE_URL` | default | `http://localhost:9098` |
| `IDP_TOKEN_URL` | default | `http://thunder.amp.localhost:8080/oauth2/token` |
| `IDP_CLIENT_ID` | default | `amp-api-client` |
| `IDP_CLIENT_SECRET` | default | `amp-api-client-secret` |

Auth is OAuth2 `client_credentials` against Thunder IDP (no static admin
token); the client fetches + refreshes a bearer token, mirroring
`test/e2e/framework/auth.go`. Agents are created through
`agent-manager-service`'s REST API — `test/e2e/framework/shared_agent.go` is
the canonical reference — not raw Workload manifests.

### Per-cell flow

```
reset OpenSearch indices
deploy_agent(cell)          # create project → agent (pins instrumentationVersion +
                            #   forwards LLM keys) → poll build → deploy → mint API key
invoke_agent(deployed)      # POST /chat (X-API-Key), retry through warm-up
spans = poll_traces(...)    # list traces → span summaries → per-span detail
teardown_agent(deployed)    # always (finally)
validate(spans) + write report
```

Span fetch reuses the emission validator: the observer's span-detail endpoint
(`GET /api/v1/traces/{traceId}/spans/{spanId}`) returns a raw `attributes`
map identical in shape to what the emission tier validates, so there's no
separate heavy contract.

### Status (not yet run against a live stack)

The deploy / invoke / poll bodies are **implemented** against the Go e2e
reference with mocked-HTTP unit tests (`tests/test_heavy_client.py`), but
haven't run against a live AMP stack. The heavy jobs stay
`continue-on-error: true` until a real run is green. Three things are
first-run-tunable:

1. **The `amp-dev-stack` bring-up** — the `make setup` chain hasn't run on a
   CI runner; watch `setup-platform.sh`'s Node check, the (unneeded) console
   in docker-compose, and the port-forwards exposing the API (`:9000`),
   traces-observer (`:9098`), and Thunder IDP (`:8090`).
2. **Endpoints the driver assumes** — IDP token URL (`localhost:8090`), the
   agent's `/chat` route + `{session_id, message}` body, and reading the
   endpoint URL from the deployments response (the e2e suite reads it from
   `/endpoints`). Timing constants (build 600s, deploy 300s) too.
3. **The observer `/spans` param names** — `poll_traces` sends both
   `organization`/`project`/`agent` and best-effort `namespace`/`component`;
   confirm the right mapping on a live observer.

## 8. Where the schemas come from

The JSON-schema contract under `contracts/traceloop/v1/` is **generated from
`traces-observer-service`'s parsers**, not hand-written:

```bash
make gen-instrumentation-contract     # regenerate schemas from the observer
make check-contract-drift             # fail if generated output != committed
```

`check-contract-drift` (run by the `verify-contract-and-manifest` CI job)
enforces both directions: if the observer adds a required attribute without
regenerating, or a schema is hand-edited without a matching observer change,
the build fails. Every deliberate concession (a relaxed `required`, a
stringified type) is justified by an `F-NNN` entry in `FINDINGS.md`.

`check-matrix-manifest` (same CI job) separately enforces that `matrix.yaml`
covers every `(traceloop_version, instrumentation_version, python_version)`
that `release-config.json` currently ships — the matrix may be a superset,
but never a subset, of what AMP baselines.
