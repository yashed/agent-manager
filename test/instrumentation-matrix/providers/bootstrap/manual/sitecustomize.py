"""Test-only sitecustomize for the manual-instrumentation provider.

Wires a stdlib OpenTelemetry SDK with InMemorySpanExporter so the cell harness
can read captured spans synchronously. We intentionally do NOT call
amp_instrumentation.init_otel() here — that function's job is to ship spans
over OTLP to AMP, which is a separate concern from "does the manual sample
emit spans that satisfy AMP's contract?" The matrix tests the contract; the
OTLP path has its own tests in libs/amp-instrumentation.
